# Link

Tuono provides a `Link` component for clientside navigation between pages of your app. `Link` prefetches pages from any links above the fold, allowing for faster navigations without a full reload.

```typescript jsx
import { Link } from 'tuono'

export default function Page() {
  return <Link href="/page2">My Other Page</Link>
}
```

For navigating to pages outside of your app (other websites), you should use the `<a>` tag.

> Additional considerations:
>
> - Any `Link` in the viewport is prefetched by default when it appears within the viewport.
> - The corresponding data for server-rendered routes is fetched only when the `Link` is clicked.

## Reference

The `Link` component behaves similarly to the `<a>` HTML tag, with a few additional features controlled by the following props:

- `href`: `string` (Required) - Relative path to the page in your application. Anchor names (links with hashtags) are also valid.
- `preload`: `boolean` (Defaults to `true`) - Whether to preload the page if the link is within the viewport.
- `scroll`: `boolean` (Defaults to `true`) - Whether to preserve scroll position between navigations.
