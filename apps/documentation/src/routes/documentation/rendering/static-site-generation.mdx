# Static Site Generation

## Overview

> ðŸš§ This feature is experimental and still misses few case scenarios. It will be stabilized soon.

Tuono is a progressive framework which means that fills all the development needs from a basic
app with no server capabilities to a full server side rendered app with dynamic data.

If a page uses Static Generation, the page HTML is generated at build time.
This HTML will then be reused on each request and it can be cached by a CDN.

In Tuono, you can statically generate pages with or without data.

> For the current development stage the whole app has to opt for SSG or SSR. Mixed rendering strategies are not available yet.

## Usage

To build a project statically just run:

```sh
tuono build â€”-static
```

This command builds all the JS/CSS assets and will also pre-render all the pages into separate index.html files.

You can still use `#[tuono_lib::hanlder]` to load remote data but they will be
just loaded at build time.
