# useRouter

The `useRouter` hook provides access to various data about the current route, as well as methods to navigate between pages, as seen in the below example:

```typescript jsx
import { useRouter } from 'tuono'

export default function IndexPage() {
  const router = useRouter()

  return (
    <>
      <p>pathname: {router.pathname}</p>
      <button onClick={() => router.push("/foo")}>
        My link
      </button>
    </>
  )
}
```

## `router` object

- `pathname`: `string` - Returns the current path name
- `query`: `Record<string, string>` - This object contains all the query params of the current route

The following methods are included inside `router`:

### `router.push`

Handles client side page navigation quickly. Useful for internal links, or for when you need to change url in some JS.

```ts
router.push(path, options)
```

- `path`: `string` - The path of the page you want to navigate to
- `options`: `PushOptions` - Optional config object for additional control
  - `scroll`: `boolean` - If `false` the scroll offset will be kept across page navigation. Default `true`
