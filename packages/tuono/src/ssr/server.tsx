// #region POLYFILLS
/**
 * Tuono internally uses a V8 JS engine that implements very few
 * browser/node/deno APIs in order to make it super fast and
 * share it within a multi thread runtime.
 *
 * While this is the reason of its speed, server side rendering
 * requires some JS APIs that need to be polyfilled.
 *
 * We basically have three ways to polyfill APIs:
 * 1. Create them with rust and expose them directly through the V8 engine to
 *    the JS source.
 * 2. Polyfill them at the beginning of the JS source
 *    (what we are doing here)
 * 3. Inject them via rollup-inject plugin, when needed
 *
 * Q: Why not all the libraries can be just injected with rollup-inject?
 * A: Leaving to rollup the duty of linking them can cause to declare them after their usage.
 *    The following APIs are JS classes, and are not hoisted, hence this might
 *    cause ReferenceError(s).
 *
 * The best solution is to create these polyfills within the rust environment
 * and share the classes in the JS scope by passing them through the V8 engine
 * (best for speed and code quality).
 *
 * This function might be a good entry point for adding such polyfills
 * https://docs.rs/ssr_rs/latest/ssr_rs/struct.Ssr.html#method.add_global_fn
