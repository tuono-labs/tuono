# How to Contribute to Tuono

## Contributions

Any feature contribution or suggestion is strongly appreciated.

We are currently managing the tasks' prioritization in the [Road to V1](https://github.com/orgs/tuono-labs/projects/2) project. You can pick any task that you see in the `ready` column that is not already assigned.

If you want to contribute on something that is in the `backlog` column, or it hasn't been scoped yet, please drop a message in the [#general](https://discord.com/invite/khQzPa654B) discord channel so we can all have visibility of it.

Consider [opening a new issue](https://github.com/tuono-labs/tuono/issues/new/choose) if you find a bug.

## Bugs
